                        Union Pacific’s strategy is predicated on being the best freight railroad in North America, which is established through safety, service, reliability, and efficiency. That sets the foundation for growth, which, combined with increasing margins, creates long term enterprise value. We expect to generate growth in three ways – increasing profitable carloads that fit our network and transportation plan; providing more products and services to our customers; and increasing the geographic reach of our franchise.

                    <p>
                        The “how” also is evident. Operational excellence and an engaged workforce with deep market knowledge and strong customer relationships will result in best-in-class safety, a customer experience that drives growth, and shareholder returns.

                        To assist us in accomplishing our goal of being the best freight railroad in North America, we announced our efficiency and business growth initiative of G55+0 (grow to an operating ratio of 55 with zero injuries), which was launched in late 2015. Additionally, beginning in October 2018, we began conversion to precision scheduled railroading (PSR) in an effort to streamline operations with four principles:
