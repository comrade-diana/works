                    <h2>A Message From our CEO to our Shareholders</h2>
                    <p>2020 was a year that no one anticipated. The COVID-19 pandemic impacted our country, economy, and Company in unimaginable ways. Our dedicated employees persevered throughout the year to deliver on our commitments to our customers while maintaining focus on the health and safety of themselves and their families. Despite this monumental challenge, we took another step on our journey to operational excellence. In 2020, we are reporting earnings per share of $7.88, which is a 6% decrease versus 2019, despite volume declines of 7%. Our operating ratio was a record 59.9%, 0.7 points better than last year’s 60.6%. These results were negatively impacted by a one-time $278 million non-cash impairment charge that reduced earnings per share by $0.31 and increased operating ratio by 140 basis points.</p>
                    <p>Union Pacific’s goal remains to be the best freight railroad in North America. Our strategy to achieve this goal is driven by a Proud and Engaged Workforce. Recognizing that a diverse workforce provides access to the skills and character we need to foster innovation and drive growth, in 2020 we announced long term goals to increase the representation of women and minorities in our workforce. Our employees are at the core of everything we do and critical to our success.</p>
                    <p>To achieve operational excellence, we must provide the Safest and Most Reliable Freight Rail Products and Services. Our 2020 safety results demonstrate substantial improvement on rail incidents, while we held the line on personal injuries in a verychallenging environment. We want our employees to return home safely every day and to eliminate derailments; our performance in 2020 has us moving in the right direction toward that goal.</p>
